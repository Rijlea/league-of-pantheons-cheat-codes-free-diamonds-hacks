# League of Pantheons Cheats and codes free diamonds Hacks tutorial

League of Pantheons Codes and Cheats free diamonds Hacks tutorial - Each hero has a set of skills to use in battle. Often, these skills also determine the role of heroes in team composition. Since the Pantheon alliance uses a turn based combat system, the cooldown of skills is in turns. In addition, there is a trigger that determines the turn they will use the skill first. Heroes always use their skills on the trigger turn - if it says turn 1, heroes will use their skills on turn 1 if they can. After that, cooling will be applied. The system allows you to consider skill triggers when making strategies. Want a round of overloaded AoE damage? The first round is the second round after polishing? If you can imagine, a heroic team may be able to do it. league of pantheons gift code reroll
